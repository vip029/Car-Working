## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#6-3排序后均值的条形图
states<-data.frame(state.region,state.x77)
means<-aggregate(states$Illiteracy,by=list(state.region),FUN=mean)
means
means<-means[order(means$x),]
means
barplot(means$x,names.arg=means$Group.1)
title("Mean Illiteracy Rate")
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
